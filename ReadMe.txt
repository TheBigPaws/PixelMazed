PixelMazed

////////////////////////////

-INFO:-

	PixelMazed was made as a final project for 2nd year Game Dev course at Abertay University. 
	Due to lack of time and unfortunate technical difficulties (you live you learn. Moral of the story: Always back up files), 
	this game lacks most gameplay features. It does, however, have solid ground (level generation, base classes, many helper functions, ...).
	
	It is my intention to  return to this project to get it to a presentable state

-SETUP:-

	1.Start by extracting the downloaded github file.
	2a. To simply run the application, go inside Executable folder and run PixelMazed.exe
	2b. To view the code, open the solution file in the Source Code file. This application has been written using Visual Studio framework.

-LEGAL:-

	This Project is open source and was made for educational purposes. 
	
	Special thanks to Sleepy K (Max Dimmer), for creating original songs for this project.
